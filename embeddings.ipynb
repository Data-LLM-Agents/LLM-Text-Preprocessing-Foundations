                "### Why do embeddings encode meaning?\n",
                "Embeddings encode meaning by mapping discrete tokens (like words or subwords) to continuous vectors in a high-dimensional space. During training, the model adjusts these vectors so that tokens appearing in similar contexts (e.g., \"dog\" and \"cat\" appearing near \"pet\" or \"fur\") end up close to each other in the vector space. This geometric proximity captures semantic relationships, allowing the model to understand that \"queen\" is to \"woman\" as \"king\" is to \"man\".\n",
                "\n",
                "### How are embeddings related to Neural Network concepts?\n",
                "An embedding layer is fundamentally a **learnable weight matrix** (essentially a lookup table) that serves as the first layer of the neural network. Unlike traditional manual feature extraction (like bag-of-words), embeddings are parameters that are optimized via **backpropagation** along with the rest of the network. Each row in the weight matrix corresponds to a token in the vocabulary, and these weights are updated to minimize the model's loss function.\n",
                "\n",
                "### Why do we need Positional Embeddings?\n",
                "Transformer architectures (like GPT) use self-attention mechanisms that are processed in parallel and are permutation-invariant—they don't inherently know the order of tokens. Without positional information, \"The dog bit the man\" and \"The man bit the dog\" would look identical to the self-attention layer. Positional embeddings inject unique signals (vectors) for each position (1st, 2nd, 3rd...), allowing the model to distinguish the sequence order and structure.\n",
                "\n",
                "### Why is overlap (stride < max_length) useful in data loading?\n",
                "Using a stride smaller than the max_length creates overlapping chunks of text. This acts as a form of **data augmentation**, allowing the model to see the same tokens in slightly different context windows. It maximizes the usage of limited training data and helps the model learn to predict tokens based on varying amounts of preceding context, improving its generalization capabilities."
